# FilzaNix

### A Java-powered Linux-inspired virtual command-line environment.

FilzaNix is an experimental command-line environment developed from scratch using **Java 21**.

Inspired by Linux shells and virtual operating systems, FilzaNix provides its own simulated filesystem, command interpreter, interactive terminal interface, and execution environment.

The project is built as an educational systems-programming project to explore how command-line interfaces, shell interpreters, filesystem operations, terminal input, and system abstractions work internally.

> **Status:** Active Development — Networking Utilities Implemented

---

## Overview

FilzaNix is designed to evolve into a Linux-inspired virtual computing environment with its own filesystem, command execution engine, scripting capabilities, system utilities, and simulated operating-system concepts.

Rather than simply forwarding commands to the Windows operating system, FilzaNix implements its own command handling and virtual filesystem using Java.

The long-term goal is to build a small, understandable environment where operating-system and systems-programming concepts can be explored through actual implementation.

# Requirements

Before running FilzaNix, make sure the following are installed:

- **JDK 21 or later**
- **Windows 10 or Windows 11**
- **Command Prompt or Windows Terminal**

Git is optional if you are downloading the repository directly.

### Verify Java

Open Command Prompt and run:

```bat
java -version
javac -version
```

You should see Java 21 or a newer JDK.

### Verify Git

```bat
git --version
```

---

# Installation

## 1. Clone the repository

```bat
git clone https://github.com/Peshimam-Ashar-Mohammed/FilzaNix.git
```

Enter the project directory:

```bat
cd FilzaNix
```

---

## 2. Verify the dependency directory

Make sure the `lib` directory exists:

```text
lib/
├── jansi-2.4.2.jar
├── jline-reader-3.30.17.jar
├── jline-terminal-3.30.17.jar
└── jline-terminal-jansi-3.30.17.jar
```

These dependencies are required for the interactive terminal functionality.

If you cloned the complete repository, they should already be present.

---

# Running FilzaNix

## Method 1 — Double-click the launcher

Open the FilzaNix project folder and double-click:

```text
FilzaNix.bat
```

The launcher automatically:

1. Changes to the FilzaNix project directory.
2. Creates the `out` directory when necessary.
3. Compiles the Java source files.
4. Loads the JLine and Jansi libraries from `lib`.
5. Starts the FilzaNix environment.

---

## Method 2 — Command Prompt

Open Command Prompt and navigate to the project:

```bat
cd C:\path\to\FilzaNix
```

Then run:

```bat
FilzaNix.bat
```

Example:

```bat
cd C:\Users\HP\Desktop\Java\FilzaNix
FilzaNix.bat
```

---

## Method 3 — PowerShell

Open PowerShell in the project directory:

```powershell
.\FilzaNix.bat
```

---

# Important: Run From the Project Directory

FilzaNix uses the project's `env/` directory as its simulated filesystem.

The launcher automatically executes:

```bat
cd /d "%~dp0"
```

This ensures FilzaNix starts relative to the directory containing `FilzaNix.bat`.

For the most reliable behavior, launch the application through:

```text
FilzaNix.bat
```

  exit      - Exit the program
  pwd       - Print the current working directory
  ls        - List files in the current working directory

# Interactive Terminal History

FilzaNix uses **JLine 3** to provide interactive terminal input.

While the shell is running, previously entered commands can be recalled using the keyboard.

### Previous command

```text
↑
```

### Next command

```text
↓
```

Commands can be recalled, edited, and executed again.

FilzaNix also provides a separate built-in:

```text
history
```

command that displays the commands entered during the current session.

---

# Terminal Scrollback

When running FilzaNix through a Windows Command Prompt window, the console's scrollback buffer can be used to inspect previous terminal output.

This is separate from JLine's command history.

Therefore:

- **↑ / ↓** → command recall
- **Mouse wheel / console scrollbar** → previous terminal output

Both can be used independently.

---

# Virtual Filesystem

FilzaNix maintains a simulated filesystem inside the project's `env/` directory.

```text
env/
├── home/
├── etc/
├── tmp/
└── root/
```

Commands such as `mkdir`, `cd`, `touch`, `cat`, `rm`, and `rmdir` operate within this simulated environment.

For example:

```text
filzanix:/home$ mkdir test

filzanix:/home$ cd test

filzanix:/home/test$ touch example.txt

filzanix:/home/test$ echo Hello > example.txt

filzanix:/home/test$ cat example.txt
Hello
```

The filesystem implementation is handled by:

```text
src/main/java/com/filzanix/filesystem/VirtualFileSystem.java
```

---

# Output Redirection

FilzaNix supports basic Linux-inspired output redirection using `>` and `>>`.

### Write to a file

```text
echo Hello > file.txt
```

This writes the supplied text to the file.

### Append to a file

```text
echo Another line >> file.txt
```

This appends the text to the existing contents.

Example:

```text
filzanix:/home$ echo Hello > test.txt

filzanix:/home$ echo FilzaNix >> test.txt

filzanix:/home$ cat test.txt
Hello
FilzaNix
```

# Networking

FilzaNix includes networking utilities implemented using Java networking APIs
and selected native operating-system tools.

### DNS Lookup

```text
filzanix:/home$ nslookup github.com

HTTP Request
filzanix:/home$ curl https://example.com


Connectivity Test
filzanix:/home$ ping github.com


Route Inspection
filzanix:/home$ traceroute github.com


TCP Port Scanner
filzanix:/home$ portscan localhost


The port scanner checks a predefined collection of common TCP ports and
reports connection outcomes and conventional service names.
Use port scanning only on systems you own or are authorized to test.

# Design Philosophy

FilzaNix is being developed incrementally, with emphasis on understanding the mechanisms behind command-line environments rather than simply relying on existing operating-system behavior.

The project explores:

- Object-oriented programming
- Command interpreters
- Filesystem abstraction
- Terminal input systems
- Input parsing
- Error handling
- Software architecture
- System simulation
- Process-management concepts
- Operating-system concepts

Each feature is implemented incrementally so that the system remains understandable, testable, and extensible.

---

# Current Limitations

FilzaNix is **not** a real operating system.

It currently does not provide:

- A Linux kernel
- Hardware virtualization
- Kernel-level process isolation
- Real Linux system calls
- Real Linux users
- Kernel-level permissions
- Native Linux command execution
```markdown
- Networking utilities are not a replacement for Nmap.
- Port scanning currently uses a predefined set of common TCP ports.
- Service names are inferred from conventional port assignments.
- Network route and connection information may depend on native OS utilities.

The filesystem and system behavior are simulations implemented in Java.

---

# Development

FilzaNix is currently built without Maven or Gradle.

The project uses a manual compilation process through:

```text
FilzaNix.bat
```

The launcher compiles the following source files:

```text
src/main/java/com/filzanix/Main.java
src/main/java/com/filzanix/shell/Shell.java
src/main/java/com/filzanix/filesystem/VirtualFileSystem.java
```

External dependencies are loaded from:

```text
lib/
```

Compiled classes are placed in:

```text
out/
```

---

# Contributing

FilzaNix is currently an independent experimental project.

Bug reports, suggestions, and technical discussions are welcome.

Before submitting changes, verify that the application still launches successfully using:

```bat
FilzaNix.bat
```

and that existing filesystem and shell commands continue to work.

---

# Disclaimer

FilzaNix is an experimental Java-based virtual computing environment.

It is **not** a Linux distribution, Linux kernel, hypervisor, hardware-level virtual machine, or replacement for an operating system.

The project is intended for educational and software-development purposes.
